    "# Text Markdown Formatting and Processing with Python\n",
    "The provided code is a sophisticated toolset designed to convert raw text into a more structured and formatted version, suitable for web and markdown presentations. This is especially useful for web developers, content creators, and anyone looking to automatically enhance the readability and structure of their text.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "1. Import and Setup: The code begins by importing essential libraries and setting up certain prerequisites. This includes machine learning models, tokenizers, and text processors.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Utility Functions: A collection of utility functions provide the backbone of the text processing workflow. They perform tasks such as detecting bullet points, identifying links, and formatting text snippets.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Text Processing: The main functionality lies in segmenting the text, determining the format of each segment, and then reassembling it into a structured format. This involves breaking the text into \"tiles\" or segments, processing each tile individually, and then combining them.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Execution: Finally, the code concludes with a sample text being processed and printed, showcasing the capabilities of the defined functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features\n",
    "1. Bullet Point Identification: The tool can detect bullet points and format them correctly for markdown.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Link Detection: All URLs in the text are identified, whether they point to web pages or images. This feature ensures that links are presented correctly in the final output.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Code Detection: Using a machine learning model, the tool can identify code snippets within the text and format them within markdown code blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Title Generation: Another impressive feature is the automatic generation of titles and sub-titles using the T5 transformer model. This adds a layer of professionalism and structure to the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Text Segmentation: Using the TextTilingTokenizer from the NLTK library, the text is segmented into logical \"tiles\" or blocks. Each block is then processed and formatted.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Table Conversion: If there's tabular data within the text, the tool can convert it into a structured markdown table format.\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, this tool is a comprehensive solution for automatically converting raw text into a structured format, enhancing readability and presentation. Whether you're preparing a technical document, a blog post, or any other content, this tool can significantly elevate its quality.\n",

    "Welcome to the Ultimate Guide to Web Development with Python.Flask, a micro web framework written in Python, was invented by Armin Ronacher.It was initially released on April 1, 2010.This guide is intended to provide you with a comprehensive understanding of how to utilize Python for web development, from setting up your environment to deploying your first web application.To get started with web development in Python, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download the latest version of Python from the official website: https://www.python.org. Once you've installed Python, you can check the version by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:\n",
    "python --version. Next, let's set up a virtual environment for our project. A virtual environment is a self-contained directory that contains a Python installation for a particular version of Python, plus a number of additional packages. To create a virtual environment, navigate to your project directory and run:\n",
    "python -m venv myenv. This will create a new directory called \"myenv\" in your project directory. To activate the virtual environment, use the following command:\n",
    "On Windows: myenv\\Scripts\\activate. On macOS and Linux:source myenv/bin/activate. With our environment set up, we can now install the necessary packages. For web development, we'll be using the Flask framework. To install Flask, run: pip install Flask. Now, let's write our first simple web application using Flask. Create a new file called \"app.py\" and add the following code:\n",
    "from Flask import Flask\n",
    "app = Flask(__name__)\n",
    "@app.route('/')\n",
    "def hello():\n",
    "    return \"Hello, World!\"\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "    app.run(debug=True)\n",
    "To run the application, navigate to the directory containing \"app.py\" in your terminal and run:python app.py. This will start a development server, and you should be able to see your application by visiting http://localhost:5000 in your web browser. For more advanced topics, such as integrating databases, user authentication, and deploying your application, you might want to check out the following resources: Flask Mega-Tutorial by Miguel Grinberg: https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com Flask Web Development with Python Tutorial series on YouTube: https://youtube.com/user/somechannel.Lastly, if you want to view some example projects or contribute to open-source Flask projects, there are numerous repositories available on GitHub. One of the popular repositories is located at: https://github.com/pallets/flask.In addition to online resources, there are also several books available on the topic. One highly recommended book is \"Flask Web Development\" by Miguel Grinberg. You can purchase it from various online retailers or check if it's available at your local library. If you have any images or assets for your web application, it's a good practice to store them in a separate directory, typically named \"static\". For instance, if you have a logo for your website, you might store it at: https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_If4ikS43_Q/maxresdefault.jpg. Thank you for going through this guide. We hope it serves as a helpful starting point on your web development journey with Python. Remember, practice is key, so start building and happy coding!\n",

    "In recent years, machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool for solving a wide range of problems. This field involves using algorithms to learn patterns from data, without being explicitly programmed to do so. Machine learning has been applied to a variety of domains, including image recognition, natural language processing, and recommendation systems.One popular type of machine learning is supervised learning. This involves training a model on a labeled dataset, where the desired output is already known. The model can then use this knowledge to make predictions on new, unlabeled data.Some common algorithms used in supervised learning include:\n",
    "1. Linear regression \n",

      "## Gearboxes and Gearboxes\n",
      "\n",
      "The gearbox is one of the building blocks of the modern car. Not surprisingly, it's also one of the most complex bits of hardware inside any vehicle.\n",
      "A car's engine connects to its crankshaft, which  rotates thousands of times per minute, according to the book Tribological Processes in the Valve Train Systems with Lightweight Valves. This is too fast for the wheels, so gears convert the power to speeds the wheels can handle. Gears use interlocking teeth, connecting small, fast moving cogs to a larger gears with more teeth, and that larger cog rotates at a reduced speed. \n",
      "Lower gears have larger cogs and enable the engine to deliver high levels of force without the car moving quickly, which is ideal when you're driving slowly or uphill, according to the journal Transportation Research Part A: General. \n",
      "Higher gears deliver more speed rather than torque, which is great for smooth  driving on the freeway. \n",
      "Lower gears deliver more power, while higher gears supply more speed — but you've got to shift your way up through the gears to reach those high speeds. Most cars have at least five gears, which gives drivers finer control over power and speed.\n",
      "Different types of gear and the applications and industries that utilize them.\n",
      "1. Spur Gear\n",
      "1. Helical Gear\n",
      "1. Double Helical Gear\n",

      "## How Automatic Gearboxes Are Making Driving Smoother\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Gearboxes have been around for a while. According-to the AIP Conference Proceedings, the first modern manual transmission was demonstrated by French inventors Louis Rene Panhard and Emile Lavassor in 1894, and Louis Renault improved the design in 1898. In 1928, Cadillac introduced a synchronized system to make gear changes smoother.\n",
      "Gears for other uses are even older than automobiles, and remains of ancient gears have been discovered dating back to 4th century China. The world’s oldest working clock has been using gears to tell the time in Salisbury Cathedral since 1386. \n",
      "Most vehicles still use either a manual or automatic gearbox, but some new vehicles have modern CVT or dual clutch systems, according to Driving.ca.\n",
      "CVT stands for Continuously Variable Transmission. It's a type of automatic gearbox, but it differs from conventional hardware in one key way. Instead of using normal gears where drivers can feel the transitions, CVT gearboxes have a cone shaped design and a system of pulleys to create a smooth transition up and down the car's power range, according to the International Journal of Scientific & Engineering Research. This is an efficient system that's often used in hybrid vehicles.\n",
      "Dual clutch systems are frequently found in semiautomatic cars, enabling the car to preselect gears, meaning the driver can shift gear incredibly quickly. This system is often present on high performance cars, and vehicles with gearshifting paddles on the steering wheel.\n",
      "Manual gearboxes aren't immune from innovation, either. Volkswagen has produced a new manual gearbox called the MQ281 that improves efficiency and reduces emissions, according to Volkswagen's website.\n",
      "Automatic gearboxes appeared commercially in the 1940s, according to the International Journal of Vehicle Design, and now they are often more popular than manual transmissions. In fact a large majority of U.S. drivers use a manual vehicle, according to Readers' Digest\n",
      "Automatic gearboxes remove the need for a clutch pedal, which disconnects the engine from the transmission in order to change gear. Instead, they use a torque converter system, relying on gearbox oil to transfer energy from the input shaft to the gears. Computers in the car determine exactly when gears need to be changed.\n",

      "## How to select the right capacitor type for any given use, application, electronic circuit design, etc\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Accordingly it is necessary to know a little about each capacitor type so that the correct one can be chosen for any given use, application, electronic circuit design, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are many variations including whether the capacitor is fixed or variable, whether it is leaded or uses surface mount technology, and of course the dielectric: aluminium electrolytic, tantalum, ceramic, plastic film, paper and more.\n",
      "\n",
      "## How to choose the right type of capacitor for your circuit design\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It is important to not only determine the right capacitor value, but also which capacitor type is appropriate for the particular circuit design. Each type has its own properties and some may be appropriate for low frequency circuit designs, others for power supplies and some for RF designs. Selecting the right type is crucial.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the main distinctions between various types of capacitor is whether they are polarised or not.\n",
      "\n",
      "Essentially a polarised capacitor is one that must be run with the voltage across it in a certain polarity.\n",
      "Some of the more popular types of polarised capacitor include the aluminium electrolytic and tantalums.\n",
